sublimeJSyntax
==============

Syntax highlighter for the J language (http://www.jsoftware.com/) for Sublime Text 2.

## Note

Instead of functions J uses Verbs, Adverbs and Conjunctions. If you want to highlight each with a different color you probably  have to extend your color scheme. 

- To find the definition for the color scheme currently in use go to: **Preferences->Browse Packages...->Color Scheme - Default**
- Find the entry **entity.name.function**
- Below that simply add two new entries **entity.name.function.adverb** and **entity.name.function.conjunction** and change their color to your liking.
